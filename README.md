# Carrene Daily Report Subject Generator

As lazy a girl can be, I decided to have my daily report email subject be generated by a routine command.
Hope other Carrene members enjoy it as I do.


## Easy Integration
### Installation
```
sudo pip3.6 install git+https://github.com/shivanouri/carrene-daily-email-subject#egg=carrene-daily-email-subject
```
### Usage
Just type the command and your Team Name at the end
```
subjectsgeneration subject --team TeamName
```
Or easier:
```
subjectsgeneration subject -t TeamName

```
Output:
```
Daily Report Thursday 1397/12/02 (TeamName)
```
